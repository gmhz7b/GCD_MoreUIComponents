# Grand Central Dispatch and UIActivityIndicatorView

### Objectives
* Discuss and implement a `DispatchQueue` to ensure all updates to the UI are executed on the main thread
* Discuss and implement a `UIActivityIndicatorView` to aid in blocking UI while critical asynchornous tasks are executing

### Tasks
Follow the `TODO` comments in the code to implement the topics outlined in the lecture

### Notes
* Places where code should be implemented are marked with `TODO` comments and will appear as warnings in the Issue navigator when building the project
* A __SwiftLint__ build script has been added for convenience
